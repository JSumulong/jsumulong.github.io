	<h1>Get out of the country they said. It'll be good for you they said.</h1>
	<h2>They were <em>right</em>!</h2>
	<p class="border">In 2013 I jumped on a plane and left the country for the first time. I met a bunch of cool people and visited all of the awesome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archaeology_of_israel">archaeological</a> sites. We went all over the country and a couple of times we <em>even</em> went over to Jordan. Here are some details about how my 6 months abroad took shape:</p>

	<p class="border">Israel and Jordan may not show up on the list of top countries to visit, but they are pretty awesome and they have a lot to offer. Here are a couple of reasons: </p>
	<ol>
		<li> <strong>History</strong> - There are thousands of years worth of ruins and archaeological sites to visit. And some of the greatest artifacts to belonging to many of the worlds oldest civilizations are housed in museums in Israel and Jordan!</li>
		<li> <strong>Cultural Exposure</strong> - Find out what it's like to haggle with the shop keepers in the Old City of Jerusalem. Enjoy some rare Druze cuisine in northern Galilee. Wander through the deserts of Jordan with the Bedouin and sleep under the stars. Learn about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict first hand! Don't let the news outlets determine your bias; go find out for yourself!</li>	
		<li> <strong>Fun</strong> - Yes, it's also fun! Go snorkeling in Eilat or hiking on Mount Tabor or enjoy the hot springs of Sataf! You can even float in the Dead Sea!</li>

	<p id="ps">P.S. Here is a <a href="http://andrewfinkcorfugreece.blogspot.com/"> link</a> to another website about studying abroad (in Greece!). This website has some fun photos, but nothing to high quality; it's mostly photos of friends and a couple of landscapes. It looks like most of the photos are taken with a cell phone and they seem to be centered on the blog, which is kind of nice. The page looks nice when you initially view it, but as you scroll down the flow of text and photo could be more organized.</p>
