					<h3>About Me</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-inner-body">
					<p>I'm a Web Developer with a passion for learning. I get excited about new technology, programming, thorough tutorials, movies, history, meeting new people, listening to different perspectives, and all things intellectually stimulating. I'm currently looking for new opportunities as a junior web developer and enjoying the opportunity to teach myself more about programming. </p>
					<p>Feel free to contact me: sumulong.jon@gmail.com</p>

					<h3>Projects</h3>

				<div class="flex-inner-body">
					<h4 class="project-title">Totem</h4>
					<p>Project Totem is a native Android application that allows users to find other users in augmented reality. This project was designed to allow the contributing members an opportunity to learn new technology at a rapid pace under the pressure of an eight day time constraint and with the expectation of presenting a working demo during the 2016 Coyotes graduation ceremony. My responsibility was to learn enough about the Android Studio dev environment, Java, and XML to create the necessary native views and behaviors for the app. I also paired with another student dev to research and develop the client side web socket necessary for the app. </p>

					<p>The front end of Project Totem requires a connection to the web socket server, which can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/JSumulong/totem-ws-server">here</a>. The web socket server is the back end of the project and has recently been deployed on Heroku using Node.js.</p>

					<h4 class="project-title">Remindr</h4>
					<p>This is a web app that allows users to store a list of contacts and schedule reminders to be sent to a contact or a group of contacts on one's contact list via text messages. The reminders may be recurring and users can specify the number of times and frequency at which the reminder can be sent.</p>

					<p>Remindr was built over a two and a half day sprint according to the specifications of an instructor playing the role of a client. I was responsible for building the user model and controller, applying BCrypt password encryption, developing the contacts controller and views, and implementing the Heroku Scheduler to scrape the database for current reminders to be sent.</p>

					<p>To view a deployed version visit https://vast-reef-98615.herokuapp.com/ </p>

					<p>NOTE: Texting through Twilio and the Heroku Scheduler on the deployed version have been turned off in order to refrain from accruing charges.</p>
