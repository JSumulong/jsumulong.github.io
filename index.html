		<p>I'm a Web Developer with a passion for learning. I get excited about new technology, programming, thorough tutorials, movies, history, meeting new people, listening to different perspectives, and all things intellectually stimulating. I'm currently looking for new opportunities as a junior web developer and enjoying the opportunity to teach myself more about programming. </p>

		<p>Project Totem is a native Android application that allows users to find other users in augmented reality. This project was designed to allow the contributing members an opportunity to learn new technology at a rapid pace under the pressure of an eight day time constraint and with the expectation of presenting a working demo during the 2016 Coyotes graduation ceremony. My responsibility was to learn enough about the Android Studio dev environment, Java, and XML to create the necessary native views and behaviors for the app. I also paired with another student dev to research and develop the client side web socket necessary for the app. </p>

		<p>The front end of Project Totem requires a connection to the web socket server, which can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/JSumulong/totem-ws-server">here</a>. The web socket server is the back end of the project and has recently been deployed on Heroku using Node.js.</p>
