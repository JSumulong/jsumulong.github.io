					<p>If you're going to be a web developer, you've gotta learn JavaScript. With so many JavaScript tools, libraries, and frameworks floating around it's easy to get overwhelmed. But before you pull your hair out trying to keep up with the latest and greatest that the JavaScript community has to offer, you should learn some plain ol vanilla JavaScript</p>

					<p>Agile development is almost ubiquitous these days. If you're a developer, you've heard of it, you've used it, and whether you love it or hate it, it has a pretty interesting history. Why not read up on early development methodologies and how the dominant paradigm has shifted in the relatively short history of computer programming?</p>

					<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/react-intro/">Complete Introduction to React (Paid)</a>
					<p>React is pretty popular and if you're not familiar with it, this is a solid intro, but it's not for the feint of heart. Implicit in the 'complete' introduction to React is a handful of pretty popular tools that are often paired with React such as: Redux, JSX, Babel, Webpack, React Router, Jest, and so on. Be warned!</p>

					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7-N8R0-KY4">FunFunFun Recursion (Free Video Tutorial)</a>
					<p>Recursion can be confusing. This is a great video that explains the basics of how to approach thinking recursively and how it might be useful when solving problems. Oh yeah, and it's short. Take 15 minutes and invest in thinking recursively. Also, this video is part of a series that I would also recommend about functional programming.</p>

				<div class="flex-item flex-item-6">
					<a href="http://www.poodr.com/">Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</a>
					<p>This is a great introduction to Object Oriented Design and because it's written in Ruby, it's even beautiful to read and easy to follow along. This book takes a practical approach to OO, so it focuses more on the <em>how</em>, than the why.</p>
